# Flush Games Case - README

Flush Games is a game development case that involves the collection and sale of different types of gems.
The game revolves around a grid-based environment where players control a character to gather gems, stack them on their back, and sell them for profit. 
This README provides an overview of the game and instructions for running and playing it.

# Gameplay
In Flush Games, your goal is to navigate the character through a grid, collecting gems and selling them for gold. 
The character can be controlled using a joystick, providing smooth and intuitive movement. 
Gems randomly spawn on the grid's tiles and gradually grow in size. 
Once a gem reaches a certain size, the character can collect it by moving over it.
The collected gems are then stacked on the character's back.

To sell the gems, the character must enter the sales area. 
Gems are sold from the top of the stack at regular intervals, earning gold based on their size.
The game keeps track of the number of sales made and the total gold earned, which is displayed in a user interface (UI).
